          'Scholarships provide an opportunity for many people to earn an education. Without assistance from an outside source, students may have trouble paying for the degree they need in order to enter the workforce and become contributing members of society\n\nAdditionally, scholarships provide an ongoing opportunity for families who find themselves in suddenly difficult financial situations. We understand that things change in families, in our jobs, and in our entire economy and our hope is that through our scholarship programs we are able to provide opportunities for families whose lives change for one reason or another.\n\nIt gives me pleasure to let you know that some of you are taking advantage of these opportunities by enrolling into the programs we shared a couple of months ago.'),
