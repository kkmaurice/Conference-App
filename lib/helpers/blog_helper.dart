After releasing their songs and getting power-play Afrigo was then invited to perform at Cape Town Villas in Munyonyo becoming a resident band under the Presidency. They were also regulars at the State House performing for President Idi Amin who was an avid fan and would invite the group to perform specifically for him and his guests.\n\nAfter the fall of the regime some group members went to exile but the band would regroup in 1982 – performing at Slow Boat then Little Flowers before moving to Sheraton and Fairway Hotel.\n\nToday the band boasts of over 22 albums and hits that include Jim wange, Obangaina, Maria, Amazzi genyama, Olimujawa Omusajja and many other crowd favorites that address politics, relationships, marriage HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n\nThe band also spans generations with over 21 members with each playing a specific role, instrument, dance and vocals.

    description: "Canada plans to bring in more than 1.2 million new immigrants over the next three years, the federal immigration minister said on Friday, as the country tries to fill gaps in its labour market and boost the economy, both hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Ottawa, Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino said the federal government aims to accept 401,000 new permanent residents in 2021, another 411,000 in 2022 and then 421,000 in 2023.\n\nCanada needs more workers, he said, “and immigration is the way to get there”.\n\n“Before the pandemic, our government’s goal to drive the economy forward through immigration was ambitious. Now it’s simply vital,” said Mendicino, who tabled the new immigration targets earlier in the day.\n\nRobert Falconer, a refugee and immigration policy researcher at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy, Friday says that if the government meets its goals, the next three years will be “the highest years on record since 1911”.\n\nIn outlining the details of its plan, Ottawa said it aims to welcome 232,500 newcomers from the economic class of immigrants in 2021, as well as family members of people already in Canada, 59,500 refugees and other protected persons. Another 5,500 people will be accepted on humanitarian grounds.\n\nCanada’s immigration system has long been held up as a model, as it has historically brought in skilled workers as well as refugees and individuals seeking to reunite with family members already in the country.\n\nThe country closed its borders to most immigrants in March due to COVID-19. Through August, it had settled 128,425 newcomers, Reuters news agency reported – less than half of the 341,000-person target it had set for 2020.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has put glaring inequalities and longstanding problems with Canada’s immigration system under increased scrutiny.\n\nMany asylum seekers and refugees face poor working conditions, while several key industries in Canada, such as healthcare, food processing and farming, rely on workers whose precarious immigration status places them at risk of abuse.\n\nA movement has grown over the past several months demanding Canada grant permanent immigration status for these front line workers, many of whom are labouring under conditions that place them at risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\n‘Status for all’\n\nAmid that pressure, the federal government announced plans earlier this year to regularize the status of a narrow segment of these workers – asylum seekers working in specific healthcare jobs – that politicians dubbed “guardian angels”.\n\nSome estimates put the number of workers eligible for that pathway to residency at about 1,000 people, however – far lower than the total number of workers with non-permanent status in Canada.\n\n“Immigrants are critical to our healthcare sector and represent one in four working in our hospitals and long-term care homes,” Mendicino said on Friday.\n\n“Whether they’ve been taking care of our most vulnerable, or putting food on our tables, newcomers have played an outsized role in our response to COVID-19.”\n\nReacting to the announcement, the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, an advocacy group, said the government should put in place “a single-tier immigration system” that ensures status for all migrants.\n\nHundreds of organisations across Canada have endorsed that demand and a national day of action is scheduled for November 1.\n\n“All migrants, refugees and undocumented people in the country must be regularized and given full immigration status now without exception. All migrants arriving in the future must do so with full and permanent immigration status,” the groups say in a letter.\n\nCanada has been hard hit by COVID-19, reporting more than 232,000 cases and at least 10,000 deaths attributed to the virus since the pandemic began.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the country’s top public health officer urged Canadians to reduce their contacts with others by at least 25 percent in order to stem the second wave of the pandemic.\n\n“To bend the epidemic curve and reduce transmission to lover levels … we must really reduce our number of contacts as much as possible,” Dr Theresa Tam said, as reported by CBC News.",

The Prime Minister noted the importance of responding to the virus in a manner that protects the most vulnerable groups in society and upholds human rights.\n\n The two leaders noted the devastating economic impacts of the pandemic for many countries and the importance of appropriate development financing to help countries bring back growth in key sectors. They discussed ways to continue strengthening the Canada-Uganda bilateral relationship and to advance shared priorities such as trade and investment, and international coordination to restore global economic activity.\n\nPrime Minister Trudeau thanked President Museveni for Uganda’s ongoing help to repatriate Canadians seeking to return home during this crisis.\n\nCOVID-19 is a rapidly evolving global challenge.

    description: "News flash — We can now confirm that the Aga Khan Museum will partner with the Uganda Canada Convention and on Monday July 2nd will host a special reception for Uganda Parliamentarians, the High Commission and other dignitaries from Uganda who will be given a VIP tour at the Aga Khan Museum on Monday July 2 in Toronto. A representative of the Aga Khan Foundation will also be a featured guest speaker during the Uganda Canadian Business Expo on Saturday June 30th.\n\nThe Aga Museum will be open from 10 AM – 6 PM that day and all Uganda Canadian Convention attendees will be offered a special 50% discount to access the Museum on Monday July 2nd. If this is of interest to you please register today and remember to carry your attendee pass to receive this special discount — sitting and access to the Museum grounds will be available on a first come first serve basis!\n\nAGA KHAN MUSEUM — In a personal letter to architect Fumihiko Maki, His Highness the Aga Khan suggested the Museum be designed around the concept of light. Light, His Highness noted, has been an enduring inspiration for the world’s religions and civilizations since earliest times.\n\nMaki responded with a design that invites direct and diffuse light into the building in ingenious ways. The building is positioned 45 degrees to solar north to ensure that all exterior surfaces receive natural light over the course of the day. Angular walls of white Brazilian granite, a material chosen for its resilience and luminosity, enhance the play of light across building surfaces.\n\nAGA KHAN PARK — In the Aga Khan Park, Vladimir Djurovic aimed to re-create the sensory experience — sounds, aromas, textures, and colours — that he experienced while visiting traditional Islamic gardens in the Alhambra, Spain and Humayun’sTomb in Delhi, India, among other historic sites. The result, he hopes, is both “ephemeral and eternal,” a space that may change with the passing light or season, yet becomes a permanent legacy for the city of Toronto. Based on a traditional chahar bagh (four-part garden), the formal garden within the Park is given a natural geometry through ordered plantings of serviceberry trees. The reflecting pools mirror the sky and capture architectural details of the Aga Khan Museum and Ismaili Centre, placing both buildings in conversation.\n\nBIOGRAPHIES — HIS HIGHNESS THE AGA KHAN His Highness the Aga Khan, founder and chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), is the 49th hereditary Imam (Spiritual Leader) of the Shia Ismaili Muslims and a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad. He was born in Geneva, Switzerland, but spent some of his early childhood in Nairobi, Kenya. The Aga Khan holds a degree in Islamic history from Harvard University. He ascended to the hereditary position of the Imam of the Ismaili community in 1957 at the age of 20. The Ismailis are an ethnically and linguistically diverse community numbering between 12 and 15 million people.",
